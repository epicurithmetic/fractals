### Fractals

Fractals are beautiful. These wonderful images, derived from relatively simple mathematics, look amazing and set the mind wondering. In this repository I have collected a few scripts which can be used to generate a number of different fractals. James Stewart (https://github.com/James-Stuart) helped me get started with his code of generating the Mandelbrot set. I adjusted it in order to create many other Julia sets. 

## Julia Sets

There are many different types of fractals. All of the code in this repository are examples of Julia sets. These sets are constructed by considering the behaviour of points in the complex plane (Riemann sphere) under iterations of a fixed function f. In general, there are many functions which can be used. However, the humble polynomials provide us with many fascinating fractals, without having to use exotic complicated fucntions.
